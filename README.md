## Conclusions and Recommendations

To avoid loss of business:
Lend out loans to candidates who can be categorized into Grade 'A' and its subgrades
Lend out loans to applicants who ->
	have High annual income (typically over 50K)
	need lesser loan (typically below 15K)
	have no previous history of loan defaults OR public bankruptcies
	are from eastern or central states 
Lend these loans at: 
	lower intrest rates
	for shorter period (36 months)


To avoid financial loss:
Avoid lending out loans to candidates who can be categorized into Grades 'B', 'F' or 'Gâ€™ and its subgrades
Avoid lend out loans to applicants who ->
	have low annual income (typically less than 50K)
	need more loan (typically over 15K)
	have previous history of loan defaults OR public bankruptcies
	are from western states
	need loans for longer period
Perform a better verification : most of the defaulters fall under 'verified' or 'Source Verified' category
